Installation
==============
To install the framework, it is highly recommended you make use of the available Python Package on Pypi

.. code:: bash

    $ pip3 install bast

This installs the latest version of Bast from Pypi.
If you would prefer to make use of setup tools, you can clone the source from the `Github Repository`_ then using setuptools, you can install it

.. code:: bash

    $ python setup.py build
    $ python setup.py install

NOTE: It is advisable to create a virtual environment for the installation of Bast Framework in order to avoid conflict among installed packages
